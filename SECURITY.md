# Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security issue in Noice API, please report it by sending an email to [shawnjsx@gmail.com](mailto:shawnjsx@gmail.com).

This will allow us to assess the risk, and make a fix available before we add a bug report to the GitHub repository.

Thanks for helping make Noice API safe for everyone!
